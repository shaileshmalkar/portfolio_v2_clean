# Profile Image Folder

## How to Add Your Profile Image

1. **Place your profile image here** in this folder (`frontend/public/images/profile/`)
   - Name it: `profile.jpg` (or update the filename in Home.jsx if you use a different name)
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

2. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Size: 500x500px or larger (square format works best)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - File size: Keep it optimized (under 500KB for faster loading)

3. **The image will be:**
   - Displayed as a circular profile picture on the Home page
   - Automatically resized and styled with a green glowing border
   - Has hover effects for interactivity

## Example Structure:
```
frontend/public/images/profile/
  └── profile.jpg
```

## Note:
- The image will be displayed at 250x250px with a circular border
- If the image is not found, it will fall back to showing your initials
- Make sure the image is a good quality portrait photo for best results
